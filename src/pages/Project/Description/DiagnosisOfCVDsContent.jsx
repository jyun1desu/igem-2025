                There are several diagnostics that doctors and physicians use to diagnose cardiovascular diseases, where almost all methods require radiation (Diagnostics for Cardiovascular Diseases, Heart Disease | IAEA, 2016). Besides blood tests and a chest X-ray, tests to diagnose heart diseases can include:
